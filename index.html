        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Mihan, an engineering student at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario. I am an extremely motivated individual who has a diverse resume of experiences in various fields.</p> 
        <p>Last summer I was employed at the JaysCare Foundation as a program leader, where I won the MVP award as one of the youngest employees there. I have also worked at the Toronto Police Service as a policing student for 8 months. These jobs required a high level of professionalism and adaptability to a variety of challenges. My unique skill set comes from this range of experience as well as my desire to learn as much as I can from each experience.</p>
        <p>Recently I have been dedicating most of my free time to a range of competitions and personal projects like this website. I recently finished competing the finals of the TD Sustainable Insurance challenge and finished representing McMaster at the Ontario Engineering Competition after winning at the McMaster Engineering Competition. I also competed in a hackathon called Deltahacks and the U21 RISE Showcase. Some personal projects I'm working on include my website EduPy which provides free and accessible beginners computing lessons and an app called Eng II Estimator.</p>
        <p>This website provides a summary of my skills, workplace experience, and personal projects.</p>
