                <h3>Python</h3>
                <img src="images/python.png" alt="Python logo" style="height: 50px">
                <p>Python is a high-level general purpose programming language. I used python to complete 10 coding assignments with an average grade of over 97%. My team and I used Python to create "AutoClip", a program that increased productvity and reduced typing strain by creating shortcuts for words or phrases. I also created "Eng II Estimator" as my submissions for the Deltahacks hackathon and "EduPy" for the U21 Rise Showcase. </p>

                <p>HyperText Markup Language is the language used to create the structure of a website and its content. Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the presentation of a website. This website is created from scratch using CSS and HTML as my first web page project. </p>

                <p>Autodesk Inventor is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program used for 3D mechanical design, simulation, visualization, and documentation. I used Inventor to complete 7 assignments with an average grade of over 97%. My team and I used Inventor to design a wind turbine and a waste lifting mechanisim for an automated drone. Our mechanism was powered by a stepper motor and was fabricated using a 3D printer and laser cutter.</p>

                <p>Mastercam is a Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) program used to manufacture parts. Mastercam is ued to create computer models of objects and guides CNC machines to create the object.

                <p>Teamwork is essential to success in the professional environment. As a baseball player, my teamwork skills have been developing from a young age. As a leader on the field I know how to play to my teammates strengths. I know how to push them to be at their best while being the supportive leader they need.</p>     
                <p>This leadership and teammwork ability translated to my role at JaysCare Foundation where I found myself in a leadership role as the youngest employee at my location.I further developed my leadership abilities as the McMaster Engineering delegate at the Conference on Advocacy and Leadership in Engineering, and I continue to look for leadership opportunities</p>
